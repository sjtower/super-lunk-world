I took a deep breath,
I pulled out my torch,
I called out to Monty,
I took one last look at the stars,

And wondered if I'd ever see them again.
And felt a cold chill rising from below.
And ventured into the unknown.
And felt excited for the upcoming adventure.

And that's when it all started.

## JOURNAL - STORY                    ##
########################################
Wow, it's been 15 years since my last entry! So much has happened since I escaped the Cave of Olmec with his treasure.
Tina and I became parents! We named our daughter Ana. She's a strong kid... and a natural explorer!
The dreams began when Ana turned five. In the dream, I'd look out the window at the full Moon and see Olmec's face in it. I tried to ignore it.
I mean, we all saw Olmec sink into that lake of lava...\n\nDidn't we?
Our curiosity was too much to resist. With Colin's help, Tina and I built a spaceship that could take us to the Moon.
Ana wants to come, but it feels a little dangerous and I think she should stay and finish out the school year. Besides, we should be back before she knows it! There's probably nothing there anyway...
It was hard to say goodbye.\n\nPart of me wishes we'd brought Ana with us... she loves space and we keep wanting to show her things in the ship. At least she has Monty to keep her company.
It's unbelievable! There's a giant Olmec on the surface of the Moon! And a cave! A feeling of deja vu swept over us, and we were drawn toward the entrance like iron filings to a magnet. A voice is calling to us... is it Olmec, or something else?
We've been in the Moon for what feels like many months already, but it's hard to tell. Just like before, time and death work differently here.\n\nIt feels like we've slipped into another crack in the Universe... like the Cave of Olmec... connected to it, perhaps... but also bigger, much bigger!
Ana, if you're reading this, then you've probably guessed that Mom and Dad are somewhere down below, trying to find a way out. I'm sorry, we should have brought you with us! But try not to worry. To be honest, we're having fun! Take your time and don't rush. Remember, it's easier to get hurt if you're not careful.
Just remember what we taught you and you'll be fine. This journal is yours now! Make the most of it and we'll see you soon!
Happy Spelunky-ing!

I'm working on a new shortcut, but I ran out of supplies.
Mind donating $2,000 so that I can restock?
This shortcut's looking good, but I ran into a room full of traps.
It'd probably be best if I just blew it up. Do you have a bomb?
I was so close to finishing the shortcut, and then my mattock broke!
Can you spare $10,000? I'll need a high-quality replacement.
I started a new shortcut, but there's a giant slab of rock in the way.
I'll need a rope to climb over it.
You wouldn't believe how many monsters I'm running into.
Can you bring me a weapon next time you're here?
Oh, you have a machete! May I have it?
Oh, you have a crossbow! May I have it?
Oh, you have a boomerang! May I have it?
Oh, you have a bow! May I have it?
Oh, you have a gun! May I have it?
Second shortcut almost finished! But walking back and forth is getting tiring.
If I had something to ride this would go much faster.
Oh, what a cute %ls! Can I please have her?
I started the third shortcut! This is going to be a long one.
I know it's a lot, but I'll need $50,000 to get this done.
Whew, I could use some help with this last shortcut.
If I had a Hired Hand it would go a lot faster...
Hey, your friend looks pretty strong! Can they help me out?
Almost there! The only thing in the way is a large door with a lock shaped like a scarab.
I heard there's a gold key somewhere near the entrance. Maybe that will fit?
That key you're holding looks like it will fit perfectly!
Sure!
Not right now...
Thanks! I can't wait to finish this shortcut.
Sigh... alright. I could probably use a break, anyway.
Aw, it doesn't look like you've got enough!

I spoiled Demi too as a little girl, but she's turned out just fine!
########################################
#### Manfred basic dialogue

We had to move our rooms when King Yama decided to visit!
########################################

I have a feeling that Olmec's challenge is hiding something...
########################################
#### Guy basic dialogue
########################################
Whew, this challenge is something else!
I don't think I'll get used to Olmec speaking to us...

########################################

Heya, Roff! What's your secret for staying so relaxed? Do you meditate?
You got spirit, Jay. You're already a star in my book!
You gotta teach me some ninja skills, Dirk!
Liz! What muscle groups are you targeting these days?.

How are you, darling!
Roffy, I think you'd be the perfect model for my new line of menswear!

Your skin positively glows, Au! You should be on the cover of a magazine!

How are your runs going, %ls?
I did some co-op runs with %ls... it was a lot of fun!
Yay, I think my practice is finally paying off!
Which items are underrated? Personally, I like finding %ls.
I hate when a promising run gets ended by %ls!
Argh, %ls got me again! I need to take a break.
I found %ls in a crate, but then %ls killed me!
Ugh, I can't believe I got %ls last run...
%ls died to %ls, too. So I'm not alone!
I'm glad we get to hang out so much, %ls!
########################################
#### Direct personality generic dialogue

I hope you're taking care of yourself, %ls.
I've been training in the Arena. Maybe I'll see you there some time?
My last run showed improvement.
When I get %ls, I know I'm going to have a good run.
My last run was going well until %ls killed me.
I died to %ls again. I think I'm in a slump.
%ls, when you see %ls at a shop, do you buy it?
I keep getting %ls. Need to be more careful.
%ls has been making good progress. I should ask them for tips.
Nice to have you here, %ls.
