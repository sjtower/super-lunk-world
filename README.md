# Super Lunky Warrior

The Blood Moon has arrived, and Olmec has challenged your best Spelunkers to rise to the task! Inspired by Kaizo Mario rom hacks, prepare to die as you test your reflexes, dedication, and luck in a series reimagined, challenging worlds.

* Fight and puzzle your way through a completely redesigned and very tough Dwelling, Jungle, Tidepool, Ice Caves, and Neo Babylon
* Quillback, Olmec, and Tiamat bossfights are 100% custom - expect fun and exciting boss battles that you can quickly retry
* Treasure, pets, and shops are sparse, if they exist at all - use your few ropes and bombs wisely
* Approach Olmec's challenge through any world - **all shortcuts are highly recommended!**
* Talk to spelunkers in camp to learn tips on advanced techniques
* All custom music! With Playlunky, click "Enable Loose Audio Loading" (will increase initial load time)
